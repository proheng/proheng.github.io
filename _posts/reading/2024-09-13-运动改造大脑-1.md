# 为什么要读这本书

[《运动改造大脑》](https://book.douban.com/subject/36418973/){:target="_blank"}，这是我第二次翻开这本书。记得几年前，我第一次在 __樊登读书__ 的推荐下，阅读了这本书。

结果，我成功地建立了跑步的习惯。而且这个好习惯到现在还一直良好地维持着。

这次再读这本书，我希望能帮助大家从书中提取出更多推动我们培养运动好习惯的理由。从认知上，鼓励大家坚持运动。更重要的是，能帮助大家通过运动来改善和提升自己大脑的效能。

关于运动的好处，我们都可以竖起手指头随便数出几个出来。如果这些理由已经能帮助你穿上运动鞋，那么确实需要称赞你。

然而关于运动和身心的一些细节你想了解更多吗？我想借用书本的问题考考你，

- 小红最近工作压力大，在朋友的建议下，她开始练习自己本就喜欢的跳绳，她在家、办公室里都放了绳，一有焦虑情绪就开跳。你觉得这个方法管用吗？
- 在进行重要的会议之前，先进行有氧运动30分钟，然后马上开会，这会导致开会的人昏昏欲睡。这是真的吗？
- 在攀岩或平衡练习这类无氧技巧型活动前，做10分钟有氧健身操，就能更好地增强大脑的可塑性。这是真的吗？

《运动改造大脑》的作者认为，运动能够减轻并预防一系列认知障碍，其中涉及的认知障碍包括帕金森病、阿尔茨海默病、焦虑症、恐惧症、抑郁症、注意缺陷障碍、成瘾行为（包括游戏成瘾）​，等等。

在教育方面，作者认为玩耍和运动有助于儿童的情绪发展，有助于改善孩子的成绩和考试分数，能让他们的认知获得最优的发展。他还进一步证明，在治疗轻度和中度抑郁与无助感方面，运动的效果和抗抑郁药一样好。

这些观点和书中提倡的运动计划均获得了多个发达国家的政府和教育机构的广泛认同和采纳。

那么，当我们遇到情绪问题，学习困难，注意力低下等问题的时候，我们有没有想到或许运动是解决这些问题的其中一个方法呢？我们如何做运动，务求达到最佳效果呢？我们能体验到运动给我们醒脑的效果吗？

就让作者从临床精神病学的角度给我们科普一下吧。


# 这本书说了什么

这本书的作者之一，约翰·瑞迪，是哈佛大学医学院临床精神病学副教授，国际公认的神经精神病学领域专家。他在本书中提出**身心并不是分离的，人体的机能和大脑的效能是紧密相连的**。换句话说，我们运动的时候，除了提升身体机能，同时也在提升大脑效能，让我们思考更清晰，学习更专注，提高心理抗压能力，消除或减缓抑郁和焦虑的情绪。对于精神病患者来说，也是一个辅助，甚至是不可或缺的治疗方案。

关于运动如何改善大脑，作者使用了不少案例分析，实验结果， 还有专业领域的研究结果，通过以下八个方面进行了分析。

1. 改善**学习**效率
2. 提升**压力**心理承受能力
3. 帮助控制或减缓**焦虑**情绪
4. 治疗**抑郁**
5. 提升**专注力**
6. 控制和预防**成瘾**行为
7. 调节**女性激素**
8. 延缓**大脑衰老**

最后，作者提出了一套完备的运动计划，目的就在于更有效地“塑造你的大脑”。

# 阅读计划

我十分期待能通过每一期的阅读笔记的更新，来跟大家分享我读到的每一章的内容的精华部分，更重要的是，回顾我在这几年里的一些个人经历和体会。

我希望这样的方法，能帮助到你
 1. 更加确定运动对大脑积极作用
 2. 更有意愿开始一个运动计划
 3. 通过培养运动习惯，进一步提升你大脑的思维，从而让你更好的掌控您的工作和生活。

# Why Read This Book

["Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain"](https://book.douban.com/subject/36418973/), this is the second time I’ve opened this book. I remember a few years ago, I first read this book on the recommendation of **Fan Deng's Reading Club**.

As a result, I successfully developed a running habit, and this good habit has been well-maintained ever since.

Reading this book again, I hope to help everyone extract more reasons from it to encourage us to develop good exercise habits. Cognitively, I want to encourage everyone to persist in exercising. More importantly, I hope it will help you improve and enhance your brain's performance through exercise.

We can all easily list a few benefits of exercise off the top of our heads. If these reasons are already enough to get you to put on your sneakers, then you certainly deserve praise.

However, do you want to know more about some of the details of exercise and its effects on the body and mind? I'd like to use some questions from the book to test you:

- Xiao Hong has been feeling stressed at work recently. On a friend’s suggestion, she started practicing her favorite activity, skipping rope, keeping ropes at home and in the office, and jumping whenever she feels anxious. Do you think this method works?
- Before an important meeting, someone does 30 minutes of aerobic exercise and then immediately goes into the meeting. Will this cause people in the meeting to feel sleepy? Is this true?
- Before engaging in anaerobic, skill-based activities like rock climbing or balance exercises, doing 10 minutes of aerobic exercises can enhance brain plasticity. Is this true?

The author of "Spark" believes that exercise can reduce and prevent a range of cognitive disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, anxiety disorders, phobias, depression, attention deficit disorder, addictive behaviors (including gaming addiction), and more.

In terms of education, the author suggests that play and exercise help children's emotional development, improve their grades and test scores, and promote optimal cognitive development. He further demonstrates that exercise is as effective as antidepressants in treating mild to moderate depression and feelings of helplessness.

These ideas and the exercise plans advocated in the book have been widely recognized and adopted by governments and educational institutions in many developed countries.

So, when we face issues such as emotional problems, learning difficulties, or attention deficits, have we considered that exercise might be one of the solutions? How should we exercise to achieve the best results? Can we experience the brain-boosting effects of exercise?

Let the author enlighten us from the perspective of clinical psychiatry.

# What Does This Book Talk About?

One of the authors of this book, John Ratey, is an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and an internationally recognized expert in the field of neuropsychiatry. In this book, he proposes that **the body and mind are not separate; the functions of the body and the efficiency of the brain are closely connected**. In other words, when we exercise, we are not only improving physical fitness but also enhancing brain performance, helping us think more clearly, learn with more focus, increase psychological resilience, and alleviate or reduce feelings of depression and anxiety. For psychiatric patients, it also serves as a complementary, if not essential, treatment.

To explain how exercise improves the brain, the author uses numerous case studies, experimental results, and professional research findings to analyze the topic from eight aspects:

1. Improving **learning** efficiency
2. Enhancing **stress** resilience
3. Helping control or reduce **anxiety**
4. Treating **depression**
5. Improving **focus**
6. Controlling and preventing **addictive** behaviors
7. Regulating **female hormones**
8. Delaying **brain aging**

Finally, the author proposes a comprehensive exercise plan aimed at more effectively "shaping your brain."

# Reading Plan

I look forward to sharing the essence of each chapter with you through updates in each reading note. More importantly, I hope to revisit some of my personal experiences and reflections over the past few years.

I hope this approach will help you:

1. Be more convinced of the positive effects of exercise on the brain.
2. Be more willing to start an exercise plan.
3. Further enhance your brain's cognitive abilities through developing an exercise habit, thus enabling you to better manage your work and life.
